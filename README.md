## 岸田楓馬 - Fuma Kishida

[早稲田大学先進理工学部応用物理学科](https://www.phys.waseda.ac.jp/)を卒業後、[合同会社 DMM.com](https://dmm-corp.com/)に機械学習エンジニアとして新卒入社。大学では理論物理学における量子光学を研究。在学中から、コンピュータ自体への深い関心を基に、国内メガベンチャー企業などとの業務委託を通じて、プログラミングやデータ解析、また、電子音楽の創作といった多岐にわたる分野で自己探求を続ける。技術と表現の融合を模索するため[合同会社ツーワンデジタル](https://21-digital-jp.github.io/ja/index.html)を設立。

After graduating from the [Department of Applied Physics at the School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University](https://www.phys.waseda.ac.jp/), joined [DMM.com LLC](https://dmm-corp.com/) as a machine learning engineer. During university, conducted research in quantum optics within the field of theoretical physics. While still a student, pursued self-exploration across various fields, including programming, data analysis, and electronic music production, through freelance work with major domestic venture companies, driven by a deep interest in computers themselves. To further the pursuit of the fusion of technology and expression, founded [21 Digital, LLC](https://21-digital-jp.github.io/en/index.html).
