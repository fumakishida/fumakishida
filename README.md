Graduated from the [Department of Applied Physics, School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University](https://www.phys.waseda.ac.jp/), and joined [DMM.com LLC](https://dmm-corp.com/) as a machine learning engineer. While still a university student, collaborated with various organizations, including leading domestic tech ventures, through freelance work, gaining experience in system development and data analysis. Also explored personal creative interests, such as electronic music production.
